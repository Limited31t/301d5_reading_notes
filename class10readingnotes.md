Site to site vpn is a connection between multiple networks, this could be a corporate network where multiple offices are on the same network in conjunction with each other or a branch office network with a central office and multiple branch locations. 
Site to Site VPN is for companies that prioritize private and protected network traffic
Site-to-site VPNs intersects, in many ways, Site-to-site VPNs were a forebearer of what we now know as the internet. They were first made possible through the use of the original packet switching network named Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), as well as the initial uses of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). 
One of the main reasons VPN gained popularity is because of people wanting to mask their IP addresses and surf the internet more safely. Hidden IP address gives you more freedom to download torrents without revealing who you are. While being on a public network, you have to deal with a constant barrage of cyberattacks, but with a VPN, you can enjoy a secure, encrypted connection. 
There are 3 different type SSL VPN’s and each has its own benefits
Remote Access VPNs refers to a temporary connection set up between two or more users and a central location.
A remote access VPN is a useful tool for companies with remote workers either on the road or in their homes. If these workers need to access private or sensitive information housed in the company’s servers, they can connect to a remote access VPN.

Intranet-Based Site to Site VPN connects more than one local-area network (LAN) to form a wide-area network (WAN).Intranet-based site-to-site VPNs are useful tools for combining resources housed in disparate offices securely, as if they were all in the same physical location.
Extranet- Based Site to Site are often used by two or more different companies that want to share certain resources but keep others private. 

An internet-based site-to-site VPN uses the existing network of an organization in combination with the public internet. To set up an internet-based site-to-site VPN, you need a VPN gateway that secures the data traveling back and forth.
To create an internet-based site-to-site VPN, you make a tunnel that connects two networks, for which you need three components:
A base network in one location
A satellite network in another location
A tunnel with security gateways on each end
MPLS can be a useful tool for organizations wanting to send data between two locations. An MPLS site-to-site VPN depends on infrastructure made available by the VPN provider, as opposed to the company that uses the VPN. The configuration of an MPLS VPN involves creating VPN connections between the primary site and the satellite sites
In most cases, a site-to-site VPN is a good solution if your business consists of several locations, each with employees that need to share resources provided by the main office. If you use a site-to-site VPN in this kind of situation, you can ensure that all employees have secure access to the same resources.
While it is important to ensure ease of access, this should not result in lax security practices. If users have to take an extra step to get into the VPN, the extra security may be worth the additional few moments it takes to gain entry.
It is easy to scale a VPN. You can add a new site, user, office, or partner organization in minutes. If you do not have to put additional VPN clients at each new location, it is quick and inexpensive to incorporate additional connections. Also, in case you need to relocate a satellite office, it is easy to set up another location
A VPN, you have the power to deploy a new solution across a broad network of devices at various physical locations. You can choose which sites to provide the new solution to first, second, and so forth. This could give you the flexibility to offer training or support in controllable phases instead of tackling it all at once and potentially overwhelming your IT team.
