What is the difference between a Windows 10 pc and a Windows server

Well at first you look at them and they look a lot alike because the home pages look the same ISH.
They both have a home page, they both can have a web browser on it but that is about all that's the same.
The server does have the GUI functions operating but once the server gets up and running then you can tell that it is a server and not just a normal type pc.
You can get an IP address so that you can run a separate type firewall system to protect your business information.
A windows 10 unit can usually handle about 2TB of RAM where the Window Server allows for 24TB.
Servers need that much memory to manage multiple computer users and multiple VB’s through hypervisors.
A windows 10 pc can use only 1 CPU where the servers can run 2 CPU’s for better processing power.
The servers don't have all the extra bloatware like cortana, games, the Microsoft store, Edge of Timeline because none of this is needed on a server and only takes up memory and slows it down.
The Windows 10 Home has a pause update feature, Windows Server can disable updates entirely through group policy.
Window servers are more expensive than window 10 pc but are a great choice for offices to have so that all stations will be saving their work to the one neutral location.
