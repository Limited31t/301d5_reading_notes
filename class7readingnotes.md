Web Server Deployment
NGINX is for open source software web serving, reverse proxy, caching, load balancing, media and streaming.
NGINX can also be used to as a email proxy for email systems (IMAP, POP3 & SMTP).

When NGINX was designed it was design to be the fastest web server around and that is still a goal of NGINX.
NGINX now supports all the components of the modern web, including WebSocket, HTTP/2, gRPC, and streaming of multiple video formats (HDS, HLS, RTMP)

NGINX is most commonly used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to manage incoming traffic and distribute it to slower upstream servers â€“ anything from legacy database servers to microservices.
A lot of times NGINX will be put between clients and a second web server to serve as an SSL/TLS terminator or web accelerator.
As an intermediary NGINX can handle task that could slow down a web server such as negotiating SSL/TLS or compressing and caching content.
