Windows domain and how does it affect my PC
Windows domain is widely used in large network settings like a big business, school and corporate type networks.
This gives a network administrator a way to manage multiple systems from one location.
Servers called domain controllers have the control over the domain and also the computers on that domain.
The domain controllers will manage all passwords and accounts and they will override the local settings on a pc.
The computers that join a domain will be managed and configured remotely and the user will not have any control of the passwords or accounts.
The only OS that can run on a domain system are the Professional or Enterprise versions of Windows therefore the regular Windows 10 home PC cant work on a domain type system.
You can check to see if your computer is on a work group or a  domain service by opening SYSTEM Security / System
A work group is a small group of computers that work on the same local network. These are different from a domain as in a work group does not control of your pc.
