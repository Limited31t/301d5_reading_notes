Wireshark
https://www.wireshark.org/
Wireshark is a network capturing tool that helps you capture network packets.
When the packets are broken down you can use them for real time analysis.
You can filter down the packets to zoom into the root causes of problems and assist in network analysis. Wireshark has a free tutorial that will teach how to capture, interpret, filter and inspect the data packets to help troubleshooting.
Wireshark breaks the packets down into 3 groups of packets Capture, Filtering and Visualization. Packet sniffing is compared to spelunking- going inside a cave and hiking around .
Wireshark is used for troubleshooting networks that are experiencing performance issues.
It acn also be used to trace connections, view contents of suspecte network transactions and identify burst of network traffic
It is a huge part of a Pro IT’s tool kit.
Wireshark will identify with different colors the findings or issues like if a destination was unreachable then it would have black background this will help identify problems easier and quicker once you know the color codes.

Wireshark is a free download and is also an Open Source application.
Once the network interface is selected, you simply click the Start button to begin your capture. As the capture begins, it’s possible to view the packets that appear on the screen
