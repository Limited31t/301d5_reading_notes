What is Patch Tuesday
Microsoft patch Tuesday occurs on the second Tuesday of the month in North America where Microsoft releases large update packages for windows 10,7 and Office.
They do patch Tuesday once a month so they can put all the vulnerabilities in one big patch instead of sending out multiples in a month.
They do this as predictable as possible so that the administrators know when to expect the updates so they can push out to their machines.

Microsoft tries to release the updates around 10AM Pacific time but sometimes it takes longer to get the updates gathered and it may take as long as the next to get them out but they will be around the second Tuesday of the month.
Sometimes Microsoft has to send out patches called “out of band” updates for a particular critical security flaw, especially if it is being exploited in the wild.

Patch Tuesday updates are called “B” updates because they are released on the second Tuesday of the month.
Microsoft also issues optional updates and these are called “c” and “D” and these will include bug fixes and improvements for security holes. After these have been then these fixes will be pushed out on the next :B” update on Patch Tuesday

Microsoft isn't the only one who does the Patch Tuesday, Adobe will also do these patches monthly. Some patches could actually be installed months after the patch came out because the roll out process is slow.

Remember that Patch Tuesday contains important security updates  and already tested bug fixes and by default these would be automatically installed for all Windows users as soon as possible.
